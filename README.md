## Description
The goal with this project was to start with no code and create a weather forcast website with html,css, and javascript. Including preset city options and a search area for a certain city.
The only tools available were past lectures and resources we learned in class,I also used help from student alumni.
The reason for making this project was to challenge what I can do with javascript and the web APIs as tools for success. 
I learned with this project that while using fetch commands, and using the data returned. You have to plan around the time it takes to fetch that data in order to do things with the data and display what you want on the page. This excersise was a good practice with realistic real world problems and solving them.
